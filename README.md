# Student Performance Prediction ‚Äì AI Development Workflow

This repository contains all materials for the **AI Development Workflow Assignment** as part of the "AI for Software Engineering" course. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end AI workflow, from data analysis to model deployment, using a publicly available dataset.

---

## üìù Project Description

The goal of this project is to apply a full AI development workflow to the `StudentsPerformance.csv` dataset. We will use a **Random Forest classifier** to build a model that predicts whether a student is a high-performer based on their demographic and academic information.

The complete workflow includes:
-   **Data preprocessing** and cleaning.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distributions and relationships.
-   **Model training** and **hyperparameter tuning**.
-   **Model evaluation** using appropriate metrics.

## üìä Dataset

-   **File**: `StudentsPerformance.csv`
-   **Source**: [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
-   **Description**: This dataset includes demographic features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, and test preparation status, along with scores in math, reading, and writing.

## üìÅ Files Included

-   `StudentsPerformance.csv`: The raw dataset used for this project.
-   `students_performance_analysis.ipynb`: The main Google Colab notebook containing all the code, detailed markdown explanations, and inline comments for each step of the workflow.
-   `eda_distribution.png`: A screenshot showing the distribution of scores in math, reading, and writing.
-   `boxplot_gender.png`: A screenshot of a box plot comparing math scores across different genders.
-   `confusion_matrix.png`: A screenshot of the confusion matrix generated from the final Random Forest model.
-   `AI_Development_Workflow_Assignment.pdf`: The official assignment report, which includes a detailed write-up of the project, answers to all questions, workflow diagrams, and references.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Open Google Colab**.
2.  Upload the following files to your Colab session:
    -   `StudentsPerformance.csv`
    -   `students_performance_analysis.ipynb`
3.  Open the `students_performance_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
4.  Run all cells sequentially to execute the full AI development workflow, from data loading to model evaluation.

The notebook will output results and generate plots directly within the cells. For a static view of key outputs, refer to the screenshots provided in this repository.
