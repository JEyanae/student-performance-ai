Project Description
This project demonstrates a complete AI development workflow applied to the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training and evaluation, and thorough documentation with code comments and screenshots.

The objective is to predict high-performing students based on their demographic and academic information using a Random Forest classifier.

Dataset
File: StudentsPerformance.csv
Source: Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams
Description: Contains demographic features (gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch, test preparation) and scores in math, reading, and writing.
Files Included
StudentsPerformance.csv – The dataset used for analysis.
students_performance_analysis.ipynb – Main Colab notebook with all code, comments, and results.
eda_distribution.png – Screenshot of score distributions (EDA).
boxplot_gender.png – Screenshot of math score by gender (EDA).
confusion_matrix.png – Screenshot of the model confusion matrix (evaluation).
AI_Development_Workflow_Assignment.pdf – The full written assignment report (for submission).
DESCRIPTION.md – Project overview and objectives.
README.md – This file.
All files are in the root directory for easy access.

How to Run
Open Google Colab.
Upload StudentsPerformance.csv and students_performance_analysis.ipynb.
Open the notebook and run all cells sequentially.
The notebook will display outputs and plots; screenshots of key results are also provided in this repo.
Screenshots
Key outputs from the analysis are provided as image files for documentation and reporting:

eda_distribution.png – Distribution of math, reading, and writing scores.
boxplot_gender.png – Boxplot of math scores by gender.
confusion_matrix.png – Confusion matrix from Random Forest model evaluation.
To view, open the images directly or refer to the respective sections in the notebook.
